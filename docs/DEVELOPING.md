# Development Environment Setup

## Requirements

- Terraform `>= 0.14`
   * We recommend you to use Terraform version manager [tfutils/tfenv](https://github.com/tfutils/tfenv)
      * `tfenv install 0.15.3`, `tfenv use 0.15.3`
- Go `1.16` (to build the provider plugin)
   * We recommend you to use Go version manager [syndbg/goenv](https://github.com/syndbg/goenv/blob/master/INSTALL.md)
      * `goenv install 1.16.0`

## Quick Start

To compile the provider, run `make build`. This will build the provider and put the provider binary in the `bin` directory.

```shell
$ make deps
$ make build
```

## Testing the Provider

The easiest way to run acceptance tests is to use the built in `make` step `testacc`:

*Note:* acceptance tests won't create the actual cloud resources since they will be run against a mock server.

```shell
$ make testacc
```

## Using the Provider

With Terraform v0.14 and later, [development overrides for provider developers](https://www.terraform.io/docs/cli/config/config-file.html#development-overrides-for-provider-developers) can be leveraged in order to use the provider built from source.

To do this, populate a Terraform CLI configuration file (`~/.terraformrc` for all platforms other than Windows; `terraform.rc` in the `%APPDATA%` directory when using Windows):

```hcl
provider_installation {
  dev_overrides {
    "terraform.confluent.io/confluentinc/confluentcloud" = "/Users/{REPLACE WITH YOUR PATH}/terraform-provider-confluentcloud/bin/darwin-amd64"
  }
}
```
